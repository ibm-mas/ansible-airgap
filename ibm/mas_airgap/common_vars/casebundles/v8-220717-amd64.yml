# Case bundle configuration for IBM Maximo Operator Catalog v20220727
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# In the future this won't be necessary as we'll be able to mirror from the
# catalog itself, but not everything in the catalog supports this yet (including MAS)
# so we need to use the CASE bundle mirror process still.
